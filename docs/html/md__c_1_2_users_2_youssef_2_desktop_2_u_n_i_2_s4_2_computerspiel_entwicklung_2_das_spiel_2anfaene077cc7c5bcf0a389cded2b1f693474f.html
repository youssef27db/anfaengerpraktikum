<div class="line">               Version 2, June 1991</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line"> Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</div>
<div class="line">                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA</div>
<div class="line"> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</div>
<div class="line"> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                Preamble</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>
<div class="line">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</div>
<div class="line">software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This</div>
<div class="line">General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</div>
<div class="line">Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to</div>
<div class="line">using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</div>
<div class="line">the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</div>
<div class="line">your programs, too.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</div>
<div class="line">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</div>
<div class="line">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</div>
<div class="line">this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</div>
<div class="line">if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</div>
<div class="line">in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</div>
<div class="line">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</div>
<div class="line">distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</div>
<div class="line">gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</div>
<div class="line">you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</div>
<div class="line">source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</div>
<div class="line">rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</div>
<div class="line">(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</div>
<div class="line">distribute and/or modify the software.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain</div>
<div class="line">that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</div>
<div class="line">software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</div>
<div class="line">want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</div>
<div class="line">that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</div>
<div class="line">authors&#39; reputations.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</div>
<div class="line">patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</div>
<div class="line">program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</div>
<div class="line">program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</div>
<div class="line">patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</div>
<div class="line">a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,</div>
<div class="line">refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;</div>
<div class="line">means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</div>
<div class="line">that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</div>
<div class="line">either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</div>
<div class="line">language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</div>
<div class="line">the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</div>
<div class="line">is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</div>
<div class="line">Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</div>
<div class="line">conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</div>
<div class="line">notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</div>
<div class="line">and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</div>
<div class="line">along with the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</div>
<div class="line">you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</div>
<div class="line">    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</div>
<div class="line">    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</div>
<div class="line">    parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</div>
<div class="line">    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</div>
<div class="line">    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</div>
<div class="line">    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</div>
<div class="line">    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</div>
<div class="line">    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</div>
<div class="line">    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</div>
<div class="line">    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</div>
<div class="line">    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</div>
<div class="line">    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</div>
<div class="line">with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</div>
<div class="line">under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</div>
<div class="line">Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</div>
<div class="line">    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</div>
<div class="line">    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</div>
<div class="line">    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</div>
<div class="line">    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</div>
<div class="line">    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</div>
<div class="line">    customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</div>
<div class="line">    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</div>
<div class="line">    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</div>
<div class="line">    received the program in object code or executable form with such</div>
<div class="line">    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source</div>
<div class="line">code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</div>
<div class="line">associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</div>
<div class="line">control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a</div>
<div class="line">special exception, the source code distributed need not include</div>
<div class="line">anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</div>
<div class="line">form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</div>
<div class="line">operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</div>
<div class="line">itself accompanies the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</div>
<div class="line">access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</div>
<div class="line">access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</div>
<div class="line">distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</div>
<div class="line">except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</div>
<div class="line">otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</div>
<div class="line">void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</div>
<div class="line">However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</div>
<div class="line">this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</div>
<div class="line">parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Program or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</div>
<div class="line">these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</div>
<div class="line">any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</div>
<div class="line">apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</div>
<div class="line">circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</div>
<div class="line">may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</div>
<div class="line">those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</div>
<div class="line">countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</div>
<div class="line">the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</div>
<div class="line">of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</div>

<div class="line"> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</div>
<div class="line"> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA</div>
<div class="line"> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</div>
<div class="line"> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts</div>
<div class="line"> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence</div>
<div class="line"> the version number 2.1.]</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                            Preamble</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>
<div class="line">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</div>
<div class="line">free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some</div>
<div class="line">specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the</div>
<div class="line">Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You</div>
<div class="line">can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether</div>
<div class="line">this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better</div>
<div class="line">strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,</div>
<div class="line">not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that</div>
<div class="line">you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge</div>
<div class="line">for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get</div>
<div class="line">it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of</div>
<div class="line">it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do</div>
<div class="line">these things.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
<div class="line">distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these</div>
<div class="line">rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for</div>
<div class="line">you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</div>
<div class="line">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</div>
<div class="line">you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</div>
<div class="line">code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide</div>
<div class="line">complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them</div>
<div class="line">with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling</div>
<div class="line">it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the</div>
<div class="line">library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal</div>
<div class="line">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that</div>
<div class="line">there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is</div>
<div class="line">modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know</div>
<div class="line">that what they have is not the original version, so that the original</div>
<div class="line">author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be</div>
<div class="line">introduced by others.</div>
<div class="line">&#x240C;</div>
<div class="line">  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of</div>
<div class="line">any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot</div>
<div class="line">effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a</div>
<div class="line">restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that</div>
<div class="line">any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be</div>
<div class="line">consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser</div>
<div class="line">General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and</div>
<div class="line">is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use</div>
<div class="line">this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those</div>
<div class="line">libraries into non-free programs.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using</div>
<div class="line">a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a</div>
<div class="line">combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary</div>
<div class="line">General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the</div>
<div class="line">entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General</div>
<div class="line">Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with</div>
<div class="line">the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it</div>
<div class="line">does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General</div>
<div class="line">Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less</div>
<div class="line">of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages</div>
<div class="line">are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many</div>
<div class="line">libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain</div>
<div class="line">special circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to</div>
<div class="line">encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes</div>
<div class="line">a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be</div>
<div class="line">allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free</div>
<div class="line">library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this</div>
<div class="line">case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free</div>
<div class="line">software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free</div>
<div class="line">programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of</div>
<div class="line">free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in</div>
<div class="line">non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU</div>
<div class="line">operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating</div>
<div class="line">system.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the</div>
<div class="line">users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is</div>
<div class="line">linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run</div>
<div class="line">that program using a modified version of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</div>
<div class="line">&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The</div>
<div class="line">former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must</div>
<div class="line">be combined with the library in order to run.</div>
<div class="line">&#x240C;</div>
<div class="line">                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div class="line">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other</div>
<div class="line">program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or</div>
<div class="line">other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).</div>
<div class="line">Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data</div>
<div class="line">prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs</div>
<div class="line">(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work</div>
<div class="line">which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under</div>
<div class="line">copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a</div>
<div class="line">portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</div>
<div class="line">straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is</div>
<div class="line">included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means</div>
<div class="line">all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</div>
<div class="line">interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation</div>
<div class="line">and installation of the library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from</div>
<div class="line">such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for</div>
<div class="line">writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does</div>
<div class="line">and what the program that uses the Library does.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that</div>
<div class="line">you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an</div>
<div class="line">appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</div>
<div class="line">all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</div>
<div class="line">warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the</div>
<div class="line">Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</div>
<div class="line">and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a</div>
<div class="line">fee.</div>
<div class="line">&#x240C;</div>
<div class="line">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</div>
<div class="line">    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</div>
<div class="line">    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</div>
<div class="line">    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</div>
<div class="line">    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</div>
<div class="line">    in the event an application does not supply such function or</div>
<div class="line">    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</div>
<div class="line">    its purpose remains meaningful.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</div>
<div class="line">    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</div>
<div class="line">    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</div>
<div class="line">    application-supplied function or table used by this function must</div>
<div class="line">    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</div>
<div class="line">    root function must still compute square roots.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</div>
<div class="line">it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</div>
<div class="line">with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do</div>
<div class="line">this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</div>
<div class="line">that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</div>
<div class="line">instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</div>
<div class="line">that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in</div>
<div class="line">these notices.</div>
<div class="line">&#x240C;</div>
<div class="line">  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</div>
<div class="line">that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</div>
<div class="line">subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</div>
<div class="line">the Library into a program that is not a library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</div>
<div class="line">derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany</div>
<div class="line">it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which</div>
<div class="line">must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</div>
<div class="line">medium customarily used for software interchange.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</div>
<div class="line">source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to</div>
<div class="line">distribute the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</div>
<div class="line">Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</div>
<div class="line">linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a</div>
<div class="line">work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</div>
<div class="line">therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library</div>
<div class="line">creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</div>
<div class="line">contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</div>
<div class="line">Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file</div>
<div class="line">that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</div>
<div class="line">derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</div>
<div class="line">Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</div>
<div class="line">linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</div>
<div class="line">threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</div>
<div class="line">structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</div>
<div class="line">functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</div>
<div class="line">file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</div>
<div class="line">work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</div>
<div class="line">Library will still fall under Section 6.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</div>
<div class="line">distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</div>
<div class="line">Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</div>
<div class="line">whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</div>
<div class="line">&#x240C;</div>
<div class="line">  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or</div>
<div class="line">link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a</div>
<div class="line">work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</div>
<div class="line">under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</div>
<div class="line">modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse</div>
<div class="line">engineering for debugging such modifications.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</div>
<div class="line">Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</div>
<div class="line">this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</div>
<div class="line">during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</div>
<div class="line">directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</div>
<div class="line">of these things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</div>
<div class="line">    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</div>
<div class="line">    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</div>
<div class="line">    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</div>
<div class="line">    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that</div>
<div class="line">    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the</div>
<div class="line">    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</div>
<div class="line">    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</div>
<div class="line">    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</div>
<div class="line">    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</div>
<div class="line">    to use the modified definitions.)</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the</div>
<div class="line">    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a</div>
<div class="line">    copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system,</div>
<div class="line">    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)</div>
<div class="line">    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if</div>
<div class="line">    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is</div>
<div class="line">    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at</div>
<div class="line">    least three years, to give the same user the materials</div>
<div class="line">    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more</div>
<div class="line">    than the cost of performing this distribution.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</div>
<div class="line">    specified materials from the same place.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</div>
<div class="line">    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for</div>
<div class="line">reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</div>
<div class="line">the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is</div>
<div class="line">normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</div>
<div class="line">components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</div>
<div class="line">which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</div>
<div class="line">the executable.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</div>
<div class="line">restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</div>
<div class="line">accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</div>
<div class="line">use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</div>
<div class="line">distribute.</div>
<div class="line">&#x240C;</div>
<div class="line">  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</div>
<div class="line">facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</div>
<div class="line">library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</div>
<div class="line">the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</div>
<div class="line">permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</div>
<div class="line">    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</div>
<div class="line">    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</div>
<div class="line">    Sections above.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</div>
<div class="line">    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</div>
<div class="line">    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</div>
<div class="line">the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</div>
<div class="line">attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</div>
<div class="line">rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</div>
<div class="line">or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</div>
<div class="line">terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</div>
<div class="line">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</div>
<div class="line">distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</div>
<div class="line">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</div>
<div class="line">modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</div>
<div class="line">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</div>
<div class="line">the Library or works based on it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</div>
<div class="line">original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library</div>
<div class="line">subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</div>
<div class="line">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</div>
<div class="line">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with</div>
<div class="line">this License.</div>
<div class="line">&#x240C;</div>
<div class="line">  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</div>
<div class="line">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</div>
<div class="line">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</div>
<div class="line">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</div>
<div class="line">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</div>
<div class="line">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</div>
<div class="line">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</div>
<div class="line">may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent</div>
<div class="line">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by</div>
<div class="line">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</div>
<div class="line">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</div>
<div class="line">refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any</div>
<div class="line">particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,</div>
<div class="line">and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</div>
<div class="line">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</div>
<div class="line">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</div>
<div class="line">integrity of the free software distribution system which is</div>
<div class="line">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</div>
<div class="line">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</div>
<div class="line">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</div>
<div class="line">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</div>
<div class="line">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</div>
<div class="line">impose that choice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</div>
<div class="line">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</div>
<div class="line">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</div>
<div class="line">original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add</div>
<div class="line">an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,</div>
<div class="line">so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus</div>
<div class="line">excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if</div>
<div class="line">written in the body of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new</div>
<div class="line">versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.</div>
<div class="line">Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,</div>
<div class="line">but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library</div>
<div class="line">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and</div>
<div class="line">&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and</div>
<div class="line">conditions either of that version or of any later version published by</div>
<div class="line">the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a</div>
<div class="line">license version number, you may choose any version ever published by</div>
<div class="line">the Free Software Foundation.</div>
<div class="line">&#x240C;</div>
<div class="line">  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free</div>
<div class="line">programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,</div>
<div class="line">write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is</div>
<div class="line">copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free</div>
<div class="line">Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our</div>
<div class="line">decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status</div>
<div class="line">of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing</div>
<div class="line">and reuse of software generally.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">                            NO WARRANTY</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO</div>

<div class="line">           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest</div>
<div class="line">possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that</div>
<div class="line">everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting</div>
<div class="line">redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary General Public License).</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is</div>
<div class="line">safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</div>
<div class="line">convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the</div>
<div class="line">&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">    &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</div>
